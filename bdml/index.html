title: Big Data and Machine Learning
description:  Machine learning is the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory in artificial intelligence. Big data is a broad term for data sets so large or complex that traditional data processing applications are inadequate.

          <a href=""><h2> Hadoop </h2> </a>
          <p style="font-size:1.25em;"> Hadoop is an open-source software framework written in Java for distributed storage and distributed processing of very large data sets on computer clusters built from commodity hardware. All the modules in Hadoop are designed with a fundamental assumption that hardware failures (of individual machines, or racks of machines) are commonplace and thus should be automatically handled in software by the framework.

          <a href=""><h2> Spark </h2> </a>
          <p style="font-size:1.25em;"> Apache Spark is an open source cluster computing framework originally developed in the AMPLab at University of California, Berkeley but was later donated to the Apache Software Foundation where it remains today. In contrast to Hadoop's two-stage disk-based MapReduce paradigm, Spark's multi-stage in-memory primitives provides performance up to 100 times faster for certain applications.
